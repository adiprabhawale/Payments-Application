# Unified Payments - React Native Banking App

A comprehensive React Native banking application built with clean architecture principles, featuring reusable payment components for domestic and international money transfers.

## 🏗️ Architecture

This application follows SOLID design principles and implements several design patterns:

- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each component has one clear responsibility
- **Strategy Pattern**: Different validation and submission logic for transfer types
- **Factory Pattern**: Dynamic field generation based on transfer type
- **Container/Presentational Pattern**: Separation of logic and UI
- **Custom Hooks**: Encapsulated stateful logic

## 🚀 Features

- **Unified Payment System**: Single reusable component for multiple transfer types
- **Real-time Validation**: Granular form validation with immediate feedback
- **API Integration**: Full backend simulation with realistic responses
- **Cross-platform**: Compatible with iOS, Android, and Web
- **Comprehensive Testing**: 100% test coverage with 30+ test cases
- **Modern UI**: Clean, professional banking interface

## 📱 Transfer Types

### Domestic Transfer
- Account Number validation
- Amount validation
- Instant processing
- Low fees (0.1%)

### International Transfer
- All domestic validations plus:
- IBAN validation (max 34 characters)
- SWIFT code validation
- Compliance checks
- Higher fees (1.5%, minimum $15)
- 1-3 business day processing

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React Native with Expo
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **State Management**: Zustand
- **Testing**: Jest + React Native Testing Library
- **Navigation**: Expo Router with tabs
- **Icons**: Lucide React Native
- **Styling**: StyleSheet with 8px spacing system
